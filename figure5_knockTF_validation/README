f1_deg_identification  
====
identify DEG using knockTF data
-- 1.5FC


====
f2_deg_bart
    BART2 results on identified DEG from knockTF data
    


====
f3_deg_homer  
	process using homer



====
f4_deg_Pscan  
	process using Pscan,
        take refseq as input
	

====
f5_encode_query_tools 
	no public packages
	not included in comparison
	

====
f6_TFEA_ChIP  
	process using TFEA_ChIP
        take Entrez gene ID as input

====
f7_ChEA3
	process using ChEA3


    
====
fz_results_compr_append
	compare/summarize results from multiple tools/methods
	compare results add newly add gene sets (TF not in cistrome, but with #DEG>100)


====
manuscript_figs
	compare the results of diff methods, using prediction of knockTF data, e.g.,
	the coverage and true prediction of datasets/TFs
	the percentage of top% true prediction of datasets/TFs



NOTES:
	we previously require TF in BART collection, and # DEG >100
	later we use all 570 gene sets with either #up or #down genes > 100 
	ALL results/slurm/script with xxx_append are for those newly add gene sets
