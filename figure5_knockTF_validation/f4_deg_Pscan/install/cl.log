# -I : Sets the path to the include files.
# -L : Sets the path to the libraries.
# -l : Use this library (eg. -lm to use libmath.so, -lpthread to use libpthread.so)
# 
# You can have multiple -I, -L and -l entries.
# So, your final command should look like this:
# 
# g++ program.cpp -o executable -I /path/to/includes -L /path/to/libraries -l library1 -l library2
